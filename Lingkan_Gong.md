**Greetings!** Welcome to my personal page on ReSim Wiki. ReSim was the primary outcome of my PhD study at [CSE, UNSW](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/). My superviosor was [Dr. Oliver Diessel](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~odiessel/). My PhD thesis title was "Simulation-based Functional Verification of Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGA-based Systems". I am still actively involved in related research, and will continue to support ReSim.

I started my PhD at CSE, UNSW, from Mar, 2010 and was awarded the Doctoral Degree at Jul, 2013. I am currently a Sr. Staff Scientist at Broadcom Sydney Pty Ltd, working on design, verification and silicon bringup of cutting-edge ICs, as well as developing software to support IC design.
