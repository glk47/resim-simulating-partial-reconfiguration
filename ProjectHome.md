## Introduction ##

_**What is Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration**_

Due to the exponential increase in hardware design costs and risks of making customized chips, the electronics industry has begun shifting towards the use of reconfigurable devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as mainstream computing platforms. An FPGA is a special type of integrated circuit that can be programmed and reprogrammed with arbitrary logic function. Traditionally, an FPGA device is programmed when the system is powered up. Using Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR), or simply, partial reconfiguration, the programming and reprogramming of the FPGA can occur at system run time (aka. dynamic) and can be performed on selected parts of system (aka. partial).

Using DPR, a designer can map multiple reconfigurable hardware modules (RM) to a same physical reconfigurable region (RR) of the FPGA, and these RMs can be swapped at system run time. Therefore, a DPR design can time-multiplexed its submodules to adapt to changing execution requirements, and its design density is increased. Both major FPGA vendors, Xilinx and Altera, have supported DPR in their tool flows (See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_re-configuration), [Xilinx](http://www.xilinx.com/tools/partial-reconfiguration.htm), [Altera](http://www.altera.com/products/devices/stratix-fpgas/stratix-v/overview/partial-reconfiguration/stxv-part-reconfig.html)). However, vendor tools only support functional verification of a DRS design when it is _not_ reconfiguring. They do not yet support the simulation of the reconfiguration process itself.

_**What is `ReSim**_

**ReSim** is a reusable simulation library to support _cycle-accurate_ Register Transfer Level (RTL) simulation of a DRS design. It aims to assist designers in verifying integrated DRS designs BEFORE, DURING and AFTER partial reconfiguration. In particular

  * It supports _cycle-accurate_ simulation of the reconfiguration process, including the transfer of configuration bitstreams and the subsequent module swapping. The designers can debug all signal activities of a design while it is reconfiguring parts of its logic;
  * It supports designs described by RTL code (i.e., Verilog/VHDL);
  * It supports mainstream HDL simulators (e.g., ModelSim), and can be seamlessly integrated with FPGA vendor tools;
  * It has a comprehensive set of user documentation to get you started. See [Overview of ReSim(PPT)](http://code.google.com/p/resim-simulating-partial-reconfiguration/downloads/detail?name=resim_doc_ppt_v2_3b.ppt&can=2&q=) and [ReSim User Guide(PDF)](http://code.google.com/p/resim-simulating-partial-reconfiguration/downloads/detail?name=resim_doc_gettingstarted_v2_3b.pdf&can=2&q=);
  * It is proven to be effective by a comprehensive set of case studies. See [Our Success Stories](http://code.google.com/p/resim-simulating-partial-reconfiguration/#Success_Stories) and [ReSim Case Studies(PDF)](http://code.google.com/p/resim-simulating-partial-reconfiguration/downloads/detail?name=resim_doc_casestudies_v2_3b.pdf&can=2&q=);
  * It is free and is open source.

  * NOTE 1: The Lines of Code (LOC) of the deesign only include reconfiguration machinery, which include modules that performs DPR (e.g. reconfiguration controller, isolation, etc) and software, if any, that controls DPR.
  * NOTE 2: The parameter script is the primary development overhead of using `ReSim` (See the [ReSim Overview](ReSim.md) page).
  * NOTE 3: Simulation overhead is measured from the profiling results of ModelSim.
  * NOTE 4: The bugs only include bugs in the reconfiguration machinery. The bugs are _real_ bugs detected in the development process instead of synthetic ones or false alarms.

The first is a in-house desgined, generic DRS computing platform, the XDRS system, to which we mapped two applications (i.e., a streaming application and a periodic application). Since the design was created from scratch, we found relatively large number of bugs in the reconfiguration machinery. A simplified version of this case study is included as an example of the release.

The second, fault-tolerant application uses DPR to recover from circuit faults introduced by radiation, and we aim to demonstrate verifying an in-house, non-processor based DRS system. We used ChipScope at the beginning of the project in order to compare ChipScope-based debugging with ReSim. We analyzed the bugs detected by ChipScope and found that all 4 bugs could easily have been detected via ReSim-based simulation.

Using a real world application, the AutoVision system, as our third case study, we then studied `ReSim`-based functional verification of cutting-edge, complex DRS designs. For the purpose of assessing `ReSim`, we modified the HW/SW of the original design. Our modification re-integrated various IPs from the original project, and `ReSim`-based simulation identified 7 DPR-related bugs in the integration process.

Finally, we applied `ReSim` to Xilinx reference designs. Although no bug was detected in vendor reference designs, as expected, simulating proven designs from the vendor demonstrated the robustness of `ReSim`. These two case studies are included as two examples of the release.

Details of these case studies can be found [HERE](http://code.google.com/p/resim-simulating-partial-reconfiguration/downloads/detail?name=resim_doc_casestudies_v2_3b.pdf&can=2&q=)
